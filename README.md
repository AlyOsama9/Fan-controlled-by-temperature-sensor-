# Fan-controlled-by-temperature-sensor-
This project uses an LM35 temperature sensor, a fan, and an LED to create an automated cooling system using Arduino. 

## Features
- Reads real-time temperature data.
- Controls fan speed based on sensor input.
- Data logging for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Arduino C
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib)
